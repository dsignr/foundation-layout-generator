foundation-layout-generator
===========================

A drag and drop layout generator for Zurb's foundation 5

Just drag and drop the required columns you want and click on the generate button. The generator itself uses Foundation :)

The full source code will be released soon! What you see here is just a compressed version out by a production rails server.

Thanks.
